My first lesson was boring and confusing. The diff thing was kinda nice though. Looking forward to more.

2........ How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Answer: Yes, i believe so.

3........... What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros are that you can decide on what to comming and on what not to commit.

Cons are that you might mess up something or even forget commiting on some changes.

4........ Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A. Because in programming one logical change comes with multiple file change, so that one can save entire working project rather than single individual file.

5......... How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A. 1) 'git log' to see commit list 2) git diff $first_id $second_id to view specific commit

6......... How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Well, now if i break something i can simply check previous versions of the program to see what version was the one that messed things up.

7.........Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I'll tell you when i actually figure it out.
